# 🚀 Game Hub Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy your Game Hub application in different ways. Don't worry if you're not an expert - I'll explain everything step by step!

## 🤔 What is Deployment?

Deployment means making your application available for others to use. Think of it like moving from your local computer (where only you can see it) to the internet (where everyone can access it).

## Prerequisites (What You Need)

### 🛠️ Tools to Install

**For Basic Development:**
- **Node.js 18+** - This runs JavaScript on your computer
  - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
  - Check if installed: `node --version`

**For Docker (Containerization):**
- **Docker Desktop** - Packages your app in a "container"
  - Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
  - Think of it like a shipping container for your app

**For Kubernetes (Advanced):**
- **kubectl** - Command tool to talk to Kubernetes
- **Minikube** - Runs Kubernetes on your computer for testing
- **Helm** - Makes Kubernetes easier to use

> 💡 **Tip**: Start with Local Development, then try Docker. Kubernetes is advanced!

### 🔑 Get Your API Key
1. Go to https://rawg.io/apidocs
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key
4. Create a `.env` file in your project folder:
```env
VITE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Never share your API key publicly!

## 🖥️ Local Development (Running on Your Computer)

**What this does**: Runs your app on your computer so you can test it.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Open your terminal/command prompt**
   - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "terminal", press Enter

2. **Navigate to your project folder**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/game-hub
   ```

3. **Install all the packages your app needs**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *This downloads all the code libraries your app uses*

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *This starts a mini web server on your computer*

5. **Open your browser and go to**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```
   *Your app is now running locally!*

> ✅ **Success**: You should see your Game Hub app in the browser
> ❌ **If it doesn't work**: Check if you have Node.js installed and your API key is set

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Containerized)

**What this does**: Packages your app in a "container" so it runs the same everywhere.

**Why use Docker?**
- Your app will work on any computer that has Docker
- No "it works on my machine" problems
- Easy to share with others

### Method 1: Build Your Own Container

1. **Make sure Docker Desktop is running**
   - You should see the Docker whale icon in your system tray

2. **Open terminal in your project folder**

3. **Build the container (this takes a few minutes)**
   ```bash
   docker build -t game-hub .
   ```
   *This reads your Dockerfile and creates a container with your app*

4. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5173:5173 game-hub
   ```
   *The `-p 5173:5173` connects your computer's port to the container's port*

5. **Open your browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Method 2: Use Pre-built Container (Easier!)

```bash
# This downloads and runs the ready-made container
docker run -p 5173:5173 saadamir1/game-hub:latest
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Method 2 is faster because the container is already built!
> 🛑 **To stop**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment (Professional Scale)

**What is Kubernetes?**
- Think of it as a "manager" for your containers
- It can run multiple copies of your app
- If one crashes, it automatically starts a new one
- Used by big companies like Google, Netflix

**When to use this?**
- When you expect lots of users
- When you need your app to never go down
- When you want to look professional 😎

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Minikube** (Kubernetes for your computer)
   - Follow: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

2. **Start Minikube**
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```
   *This creates a mini Kubernetes cluster on your computer*

### Method 1: Deploy Everything at Once (Recommended)

1. **Deploy your app**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```
   *This reads all the YAML files in your k8s folder and creates everything*

2. **Check if it's working**
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments
   kubectl get services
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   *These commands show you the status of your app*

3. **Access your app**
   ```bash
   # Get the URL to access your app
   minikube service game-hub-service --url
   ```
   *Or go directly to: http://localhost:30080*

### Method 2: Step by Step (If you want to understand each part)

1. **Deploy the application**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```
   *This creates the containers running your app*

2. **Create the service (so people can access it)**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
   ```
   *This creates a "door" for people to reach your app*

3. **Optional: Create ingress (advanced routing)**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
   ```
   *This is like a fancy receptionist that directs traffic*

### 🔍 Checking if Everything Works

```bash
# See everything at once
kubectl get all

# See what your app is saying (logs)
kubectl logs -l app=game-hub

# If you can't access the app, try this
kubectl port-forward service/game-hub-service 8080:80
# Then go to http://localhost:8080
```

> 🎉 **Success**: Your app is now running on Kubernetes!
> 🚨 **If pods are not "Running"**: Check the troubleshooting section below

## ⚙️ Helm Deployment (Easy Kubernetes)

**What is Helm?**
- Think of it as "one-click install" for Kubernetes
- Instead of managing many YAML files, you use one simple command
- Like an "app store" for Kubernetes applications

**Why use Helm?**
- Much easier than raw Kubernetes
- You can easily change settings
- Easy to upgrade or rollback

### Prerequisites
1. **Make sure Kubernetes is running** (from previous step)
2. **Install Helm**
   - Follow: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

### Simple Installation

```bash
# Install your app with one command!
helm install game-hub ./my-game-hub
```
*This reads your Helm chart and creates everything in Kubernetes*

### Custom Installation (Change Settings)

```bash
# Install with custom settings
helm install game-hub ./my-game-hub \
  --set image.repository=saadamir1/game-hub \
  --set image.tag=latest \
  --set service.nodePort=30080
```
*The `--set` options let you customize how your app runs*

### Managing Your App

```bash
# See all your Helm apps
helm list

# Check if your app is healthy
helm status game-hub

# Update your app
helm upgrade game-hub ./my-game-hub

# Remove your app completely
helm uninstall game-hub
```

### 🎯 Access Your App

After installation:
1. Wait a minute for everything to start
2. Go to: http://localhost:30080
3. Your Game Hub should be running!

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Helm is the easiest way to use Kubernetes!

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (Automatic Deployment)

**What is CI/CD?**
- **CI** = Continuous Integration (automatically test your code)
- **CD** = Continuous Deployment (automatically deploy your code)
- Think of it as a "robot assistant" that deploys your app whenever you make changes

**What happens automatically?**
1. You push code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions (the robot) wakes up
3. It builds your Docker container
4. It pushes the container to Docker Hub
5. It deploys your app to Kubernetes
6. Your app is live with the new changes!

### 🚀 How It Works

**When does it run?**
- Every time you push to the `master` branch
- Every time someone creates a pull request

**What does it do?**

**Step 1: Build Your App**
- Downloads your code
- Logs into Docker Hub
- Builds a new Docker container
- Uploads it to Docker Hub with these names:
  - `saadamir1/game-hub:latest` (always the newest)
  - `saadamir1/game-hub:master` (from master branch)
  - `saadamir1/game-hub:abc123` (specific version)

**Step 2: Deploy Your App**
- Creates a test Kubernetes cluster
- Installs your app using Helm
- Tests if everything works

### 🔧 Setting It Up

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
3. **Add these secrets:**
   ```
   DOCKER_USERNAME = your_docker_hub_username
   DOCKER_PASSWORD = your_docker_hub_password
   ```

4. **That's it!** Now every time you push code, it automatically deploys!

### 🎯 Checking if It Worked

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click the "Actions" tab**
3. **You'll see a list of all deployments**
4. **Green checkmark = success, Red X = something went wrong**

> 🎉 **Amazing**: You now have professional-level automatic deployment!
> 🐛 **If it fails**: Check the Actions tab for error messages

## 🌐 Vercel Deployment (Easiest Web Hosting)

**What is Vercel?**
- A website hosting service (like a hotel for websites)
- Super easy to use

   ```

### 🔧 Technical Details (You Don't Need to Understand This)

The `vercel.json` file in your project tells Vercel how to handle your React app:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}
```
*This makes sure all URLs work correctly with React Router*

> 🎉 **Success**: Your app is now live on the internet!
> 🌍 **Share it**: Send the Vercel URL to friends and family
> 💡 **Pro Tip**: This is the easiest way to show off your project!

## 🚨 When Things Go Wrong

Don't panic! Every developer faces these issues. Here's how to fix common problems:

### 😵 "My app shows a blank page"

**Most likely cause**: Missing API key

**How to fix**:
1. Check if you have a `.env` file in your project root
2. Make sure it contains: `VITE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key`
3. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
4. For Docker: `docker run -e VITE_API_KEY=your_key -p 5173:5173 game-hub`

### 🐳 Docker Problems

**"Docker build fails"**
```bash
# Clear everything and try again
docker system prune -a
docker build --no-cache -t game-hub .
```

**"Can't access http://localhost:5173"**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Check if the container is running: `docker ps`
- Try a different port: `docker run -p 3000:5173 game-hub`

### ☸️ Kubernetes Problems

**"Pods are not starting"**

1. **Check what's wrong**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name-from-above>
   ```

2. **Look at the logs**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```

3. **Common fixes**:
   - Wait longer (sometimes takes 2-3 minutes)
   - Check if Docker image exists: `docker pull saadamir1/game-hub:latest`
   - Restart everything: `kubectl delete -f k8s/` then `kubectl apply -f k8s/`

**"Can't access my app"**

1. **Find the right URL**:
   ```bash
   # For Minikube
   minikube service game-hub-service --url
   
   # For Docker Desktop
   # Try: http://localhost:30080
   ```

2. **If that doesn't work, use port forwarding**:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/game-hub-service 8080:80
   # Then go to: http://localhost:8080
   ```

### ⚙️ Helm Problems

**"Helm install failed"**

1. **Check what Helm would create**:
   ```bash
   helm template game-hub ./my-game-hub
   ```

2. **Check the status**:
   ```bash
   helm status game-hub
   ```

3. **Start over**:
   ```bash
   helm uninstall game-hub
   helm install game-hub ./my-game-hub
   ```

### 🌐 Vercel Problems

**"Build failed on Vercel"**
- Check if your code works locally first: `npm run build`
- Make sure you added the `VITE_API_KEY` environment variable in Vercel dashboard
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard for specific errors

**"App deployed but shows errors"**
- Check the Function Logs in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure your API key is correct
- Try redeploying: go to Deployments tab and click "Redeploy"

### 🔍 General Debugging Tips

1. **Check if it works locally first**
   - If `npm run dev` doesn't work, fix that before trying other deployments

2. **Read error messages carefully**
   - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
   - Google the error message if you don't understand it

3. **Check one thing at a time**
   - Don't try to fix multiple issues simultaneously
   - Start with the simplest deployment (Vercel) and work up

4. **When in doubt, restart everything**
   - Close terminal, restart Docker, restart your computer
   - Sometimes that's all you need!

### 🆘 Still Stuck?

1. **Check the GitHub Issues** in your repository
2. **Ask on Stack Overflow** with specific error messages
3. **Join Discord communities** for React, Docker, or Kubernetes
4. **Remember**: Every expert was once a beginner who got stuck too!

> 💪 **You've got this!** Deployment is tricky, but you've already built an amazing app!

## 🚀 Advanced Topics (When You're Ready)

### 📊 Making Your App Handle More Users

**What is scaling?**
When lots of people use your app, you might need more "copies" running to handle everyone.

**Automatic scaling with Kubernetes:**
```bash
# Edit your Helm values.yaml file
autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 1      # Always have at least 1 copy
  maxReplicas: 3      # Never more than 3 copies
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80  # Create new copy when CPU hits 80%
```

**Check how your app is doing:**
```bash
kubectl top pods    # See CPU and memory usage
kubectl get hpa     # See autoscaling status
```

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

**For Production (Real Users):**
- 🔐 Store API keys as Kubernetes secrets (not in plain text)
- 🏷️ Use specific version tags instead of `latest`
- 📊 Set memory and CPU limits so one app doesn't crash everything
- 🌐 Always use HTTPS (secure connections)
- 🚫 Don't run containers as root user

**Example of better security:**
```yaml
# In your deployment.yaml
resources:
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
```
